# bat-files
Just a collection of some batch files I made for some reason. Create a PR and add your own!
Likely there will be some bash scripts in there too eventually.
## hd-fill.bat
Fills a hard drive very quickly (Pretty sure that the only bottleneck is hdd speed (or cpu if you suck)) with a very large file.
